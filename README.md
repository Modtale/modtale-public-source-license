# Modtale Public Source License (MPSL) v1.0

The Modtale Public Source License (MPSL) is a strong copyleft license that requires source code disclosure for derivatives and network use, while restricting binary distribution exclusively to the Modtale Platform.

All rights reserved.

## Overview

MPSL is designed to balance open collaboration with controlled distribution.

It allows anyone to:

* Use the source code
* Modify the source code
* Fork the project
* Distribute source code and derivatives

It requires that:

* All derivatives remain licensed under MPSL v1.0
* Complete corresponding source code is made available
* Network deployments provide public access to source code

It restricts that:

* Compiled binaries may only be distributed through the Modtale Platform
* No external mirrors, app stores, repositories, or third-party binary distribution are allowed

## Key Features

Copyleft
All forks and derivative works must remain under MPSL v1.0.

Network Use Clause
If you run a modified version over a network (API, server, hosted service), you must provide users with access to the full corresponding source code.

Platform-Locked Binaries
Compiled binaries may only be distributed via the official Modtale Platform.

Private Use Exception
You may compile and use binaries privately, but you may not share them outside your private environment.

Sunset Clause
If the Modtale Platform becomes defunct for 60 consecutive days, the binary distribution restriction permanently terminates.

Relicensing Authority
The Lead Maintainer may relicense the project under AGPL-3.0, GPL-3.0, or MIT.

## Contributor License Agreement

All contributions are governed by the included Contributor License Agreement (CLA).
Contributors retain copyright but grant the project rights under MPSL and grant the Lead Maintainer relicensing authority.
