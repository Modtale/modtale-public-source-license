# Modtale Public Source License (MPSL) v1.0
Copyright © 2026 Modtale.

All rights reserved.

This Modtale Public Source License (the "License") is a legal agreement between you (either an individual or a single entity) and the Project and its Contributors (collectively, the "Licensor"). By exercising any rights granted under this License, you agree to be bound by its terms and conditions. If you do not agree to the terms of this License, you must not access, use, or otherwise exercise any rights with respect to the Software.

---
## Preamble
WHEREAS, the Licensor desires to make available certain software, including source code and related materials, under terms that promote open collaboration while imposing specific restrictions on the distribution of compiled binaries to ensure controlled dissemination through designated channels;

WHEREAS, the Licensor seeks to balance the principles of open source development with the need to maintain platform integrity and user ecosystem coherence;

WHEREAS, this License is designed for adoption by any project, with the binary distribution restrictions tied exclusively to the Modtale Platform as defined herein, irrespective of the adopting project's name or nature;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein, the parties agree as follows:

---
## Definitions
For the purposes of this License, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:

1. "Software" means the original software program(s) made available by the Licensor under this License, including all source code, object code, documentation, and any associated files or materials, in their original form or as modified.

2. "Source Code" means the preferred form of the Software for making modifications to it, including all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, scripts used to control compilation and installation of an executable, and any other human-readable form.

3. "Object Code" or "Compiled Binaries" means any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of the Source Code, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.

4. "Contributor" means the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making the Software available under this License, including the original Licensor and any subsequent contributors who submit modifications or additions.

5. "You" (or "Your") means an individual or legal entity exercising permissions granted by this License.

6. "Distribute" or "Convey" means to make available to a third party, whether by sale, lease, gift, or any other means of transfer, including but not limited to electronic transmission, physical delivery, or making accessible over a network.

7. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Software, such as a revision, modification, translation, abridgment, condensation, expansion, or any other form in which the Software may be recast, transformed, or adapted, including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

8. "Fork" means a separate version of the Software created by copying and modifying the Source Code, which may diverge from the original development path, and which is maintained independently but remains subject to this License.

9. "Fork Chain" means the hierarchical sequence of projects originating from the Root Project (as defined below), where each subsequent project is a Fork or Derivative Work of a prior project in the chain, tracing back linearly or through branches to the Root Project. The Fork Chain includes all upstream and downstream relationships, whether direct or indirect, and is determined by the provenance of the Source Code, as evidenced by version control history, commit logs, or other documentation establishing the derivation lineage.

10. "Root Project" means the original, uppermost project in the Fork Chain that first adopted and applied this License (MPSL v1.0) to the Software or a substantial portion thereof, from which all subsequent Forks, Derivative Works, and modified versions in the Fork Chain descend. If a project in the Fork Chain is not licensed under this License, the Root Project shall be deemed the closest upstream project in the chain that is licensed under this License, tracing back until such a project is identified. The Root Project is the foundational anchor for all relicensing authority under this License.

11. "Modtale Platform" means the official online platform operated under the Modtale initiative, accessible via the primary domain modtale.net or any successor domain officially designated and publicly announced through the official channels of the Modtale Platform, including all associated servers, APIs, and distribution infrastructure used for hosting and disseminating software licensed under this License. For the avoidance of doubt, the designation of any successor domain must be made via an official announcement published on the current Modtale Platform's website, documentation, or other publicly accessible resources controlled by the Modtale Platform itself, and such announcement shall be verifiable by objective means such as archived web pages or public records. No individual, including the Lead Maintainer of the Root Project, may unilaterally designate a successor domain outside of this process.

12. "Lead Maintainer" means the individual or entity designated as having primary responsibility for the ongoing development, maintenance, and governance of the Root Project, as determined by the Root Project's official governance documentation, bylaws, or established practices. The Lead Maintainer is initially the entity or individual who established the Root Project under this License. Succession of the Lead Maintainer role shall be governed solely by the Root Project's internal mechanisms, and no Fork, Derivative Work, or downstream project in the Fork Chain shall have independent authority to appoint or recognize a separate Lead Maintainer for purposes of this License. In the event of ambiguity or dispute regarding the identity of the Lead Maintainer, it shall be resolved by reference to the Root Project's canonical repository or official records, and no downstream maintainer shall usurp or claim such authority. For clarity, the Lead Maintainer is exclusively tied to the Root Project and does not extend to or vest in the maintainers of any Forks or Derivative Works, regardless of their independence or divergence.

13. "Defunct State" means a condition in which the primary domain and official distribution infrastructure of the Modtale Platform are non-functional and inaccessible to the public for a continuous period of sixty (60) calendar days, as evidenced by objective indicators such as persistent domain resolution failures, server downtime, or official announcements of cessation.

14. "Network Use" means making the Software or any modified version thereof available for interaction over a computer network, including but not limited to as a server, application programming interface (API), modification platform, hosted service, or any other form of remote access.

15. "Private Use" means use of the Software solely for internal, non-commercial purposes by You, without Distribution to any third party.

## 1. Grant of Copyright License (Source Code)
Subject to Your full and ongoing compliance with all terms and conditions of this License, including without limitation the restrictions and obligations set forth herein, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this License) copyright license to:

* Use, reproduce, and modify the Source Code of the Software;
* Prepare Derivative Works based upon the Source Code;
* Publicly perform and publicly display the Software and any Derivative Works;
* Distribute copies of the Source Code and Derivative Works thereof to third parties.

All Redistributions of the Source Code, whether in original or modified form, must be licensed under the exact terms of this License (MPSL v1.0) without any alteration, addition, or subtraction, except as expressly permitted herein. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You Distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Source Code that alter or restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.

This grant does not include any rights to trademarks, patents, or other intellectual property rights except as explicitly stated in this License.

---
## 2. Copyleft Requirement
Any modified version, Derivative Work, or Fork of the Software that You create or to which You contribute must:

* Be licensed in its entirety under the terms of this License, without any additional terms or conditions that conflict with or restrict the rights granted herein;
* Include a prominent notice in each modified file and in the overall distribution, stating that modifications have been made, identifying the nature of such modifications, and providing the date of modification and the identity of the modifier;
* Make the complete corresponding Source Code of such modified version, Derivative Work, or Fork available to all recipients at no charge, in a form that is convenient for further modification, such as through a publicly accessible repository or upon request.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License with respect to the Source Code. For example, You may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and You may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Software or any portion thereof.

If You Distribute the Software in a manner that combines it with other software not governed by this License, You must ensure that the licensing of the combined work does not restrict the rights to the Software granted under this License.

---
## 3. Network Use Provision
If You modify the Software or create a Derivative Work and You make such modified Software or Derivative Work available for Network Use (including but not limited to deployment as a server, API, modification platform, or hosted service), You must:

* Provide all users who interact with it remotely through a computer network with immediate and unrestricted access to download or otherwise obtain the complete corresponding Source Code of the modified version or Derivative Work, at no charge;
* Ensure that such Source Code is provided in a form that includes all modifications and is suitable for further modification and use under this License;
* Include a prominent notice in the user interface or documentation informing users of their right to access the Source Code and providing instructions on how to obtain it.

This obligation applies regardless of whether the Software is Distributed in Object Code form or whether the Network Use occurs without explicit Distribution of the Software. The Source Code must be made available concurrently with the Network Use and must remain available for as long as the Network Use continues. Failure to comply with this provision constitutes a material breach of this License.

---
## 4. Binary Distribution Restriction (Platform Lock)
Notwithstanding the broad permissions granted for the Source Code in Sections 1 through 3 above, the following restrictions apply to the Distribution of Object Code or Compiled Binaries:

### 4.1 General Rule
Compiled Binaries (including Object Code) of the Software, including all Forks, Derivative Works, and modified versions thereof, may only be Distributed exclusively through the Modtale Platform. Distribution of such Compiled Binaries through any third-party repositories, websites, hosting services, file-sharing platforms, app stores, or any other external means is strictly prohibited, whether directly or indirectly.

### 4.2 Scope
This restriction applies without exception to:

* The original Software in its unmodified form;
* All Forks of the Software;
* All Derivative Works based upon the Software;
* All modified builds, patches, or enhancements to the Software;

Regardless of whether the distributor is an individual, a commercial entity, a non-profit organization, or any other type of entity, and irrespective of whether the Distribution is for commercial gain or non-commercial purposes. This includes prohibitions on bundling the Compiled Binaries with other software, embedding them in hardware devices, or making them available via automated build systems outside the Modtale Platform.

### 4.3 Private Use Exception
Notwithstanding the foregoing, You may compile the Source Code into Object Code or Compiled Binaries and use such binaries solely for Your own Private Use, without any restriction, provided that such binaries are not Distributed, conveyed, or made available to any third party in any manner. This exception does not permit any form of sharing, even for testing or collaborative purposes, unless conducted entirely within the confines of Your private environment.

### 4.4 Enforcement
Any attempt to circumvent this restriction, including through proxy distributions, mirroring, or unauthorized APIs, shall be considered a violation of this License. The Licensor reserves the right to monitor compliance and take appropriate action, including but not limited to seeking injunctive relief.

---
## 5. Sunset Clause
In the event that the Modtale Platform enters a Defunct State, as defined herein, then:

* The entirety of Section 4 (Binary Distribution Restriction) shall permanently and irrevocably terminate, effective immediately upon the expiration of the sixty (60) day period;
* Thereafter, the Software, including all Forks and Derivative Works, may be freely Distributed in both Source Code and Compiled Binary forms under the remaining terms of this License, without any platform-specific restrictions.

The determination of a Defunct State shall be based on objective and publicly verifiable evidence of the unavailability of the official Modtale distribution platform, such as widespread reports of inaccessibility, failure of domain name system resolution, or cessation of official maintenance announcements. No formal declaration by the Licensor is required for this clause to take effect; it operates automatically upon meeting the defined criteria.

Once triggered, this Sunset Clause cannot be revoked, even if the Modtale Platform is subsequently restored or relaunched under new management.

---
## 6. No Sublicensing Under Alternative Terms
You may not sublicense, relicense, or otherwise grant rights to the Software or any portion thereof under any terms different from those set forth in this License, except as expressly permitted under Section 8 (Lead Maintainer Relicensing Authority). Any attempt to do so is null and void and constitutes a material breach of this License.

This prohibition includes, but is not limited to, incorporating the Software into proprietary software, applying dual-licensing schemes without authorization, or imposing end-user license agreements that conflict with this License. For the avoidance of doubt, no Fork, Derivative Work, or downstream project in the Fork Chain shall have the authority to relicense the Software or any contributions thereto, as such authority is vested exclusively in the Lead Maintainer of the Root Project.

---
## 7. Termination
Your rights under this License shall terminate automatically and immediately upon any violation of its terms, including but not limited to failure to comply with the copyleft requirements, Network Use provisions, or Binary Distribution restrictions.

However, if You cure the violation within thirty (30) calendar days after receiving notice of the violation from the Licensor or any affected party, Your rights under this License shall be reinstated retroactively, provided that such cure fully remedies the breach and no irreparable harm has occurred.

Termination of Your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of any parties who have received copies or rights from You under this License, provided such parties remain in full compliance therewith. Reinstatement is automatic if You cure the violation as described, but repeated violations may result in permanent termination at the discretion of the Lead Maintainer of the Root Project.

In the event of termination, You must immediately cease all use, modification, and Distribution of the Software and destroy all copies in Your possession.

---
## 8. Lead Maintainer Relicensing Authority
The Lead Maintainer of the Root Project, and only the Lead Maintainer of the Root Project, reserves the exclusive and irrevocable right, at any time and in its sole discretion, to relicense the entire Software, including all past, present, and future contributions thereto across the entire Fork Chain, under one of the following open source licenses:

* GNU Affero General Public License version 3.0 (AGPL-3.0);
* GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0);
* MIT License.

For absolute clarity, this relicensing authority does not extend to, and may not be exercised by, any maintainer, contributor, or entity associated with any Fork, Derivative Work, or downstream project in the Fork Chain, regardless of the independence, size, or activity of such project. Any purported relicensing by a non-Root Project entity is null, void, and without effect, and shall constitute a material breach of this License. The authority is tethered exclusively to the Root Project to preserve the integrity of the original licensing intent and to prevent fragmentation or unauthorized alterations in downstream variants.

Upon the effective date of such relicensing, as announced by the Lead Maintainer of the Root Project through official channels associated with the Root Project:

* This License (MPSL v1.0) shall terminate for all future Distributions and uses of the Software across the entire Fork Chain;
* The newly selected license shall govern all subsequent dealings with the Software, including rights to existing copies in all projects within the Fork Chain, subject to the terms of the selected license.

This authority extends to all contributions submitted under the Contributor License Agreement, and Contributors hereby grant the necessary permissions for such relicensing solely to the Lead Maintainer of the Root Project. No Contributor, licensee, or downstream project maintainer may challenge, interfere with, or purport to exercise this relicensing authority.

In the event of a dispute regarding the identity of the Root Project or Lead Maintainer, resolution shall be sought through arbitration in accordance with Section 13, with reference to objective evidence such as the earliest public release under this License, version control history, or official project records.

---
## 9. Patent License Grant
Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Software, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their contribution(s) alone or by combination of their contribution(s) with the Software to which such contribution(s) was submitted.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Software or a contribution incorporated within the Software constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Software shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

---
## 10. Trademark
This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor or any Contributor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Software.

You must not use any such marks in a way that suggests affiliation with or endorsement by the Licensor without prior written permission.

---
## 11. Disclaimer of Warranty
UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, LICENSOR PROVIDES THE SOFTWARE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATENESS OF USING OR REDISTRIBUTING THE SOFTWARE AND ASSUME ANY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR EXERCISE OF PERMISSIONS UNDER THIS LICENSE.

---
## 12. Limitation of Liability
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY LICENSOR OR CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE SOFTWARE TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

---
## 13. Interpretation and Severability
If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be modified and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law, and the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.

---
## 14. Entire Agreement
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Software licensed hereunder and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements, whether oral or written.

No amendment or modification of this License will be binding unless in writing and signed by the Lead Maintainer of the Root Project.

---
# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
By submitting a contribution to the Software (a "Contribution"), whether through code, documentation, bug reports, or any other means, You agree to the following terms, which form a binding agreement between You and the Project, with rights extending to the Root Project as defined in the License:

1. You retain full copyright ownership to Your Contribution, including all intellectual property rights therein.

2. You hereby grant to the Project, the Root Project, and all recipients of the Software a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable license to Your Contribution under the terms of the Modtale Public Source License (MPSL v1.0), including the right to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, and Distribute Your Contribution as part of the Software.

3. You hereby grant to the Lead Maintainer of the Root Project (and exclusively to such Lead Maintainer, without extension to any downstream maintainers) an irrevocable, perpetual right to relicense Your Contribution, in whole or in part, under any of the following licenses: GNU Affero General Public License version 3.0 (AGPL-3.0), GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0), or MIT License, without further notice or consent from You. For clarity, this grant does not confer relicensing authority to any Fork, Derivative Work, or downstream project in the Fork Chain.

4. You represent and warrant that: (a) You are the original author of the Contribution or have sufficient rights to grant the licenses herein; (b) the Contribution does not infringe any third-party intellectual property rights, including copyrights, patents, trademarks, or trade secrets; (c) You have not previously assigned or encumbered the rights to the Contribution in a manner that conflicts with this CLA; and (d) if the Contribution is made on behalf of an employer or other entity, You are authorized to bind such entity to this CLA.

5. You agree to notify the Project and the Root Project of any facts or circumstances of which You become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.

6. This CLA applies to all Contributions You submit, past, present, and future, unless You explicitly withdraw consent in writing prior to submission, which withdrawal shall not affect previously submitted Contributions.

7. No fee or compensation is required for submitting a Contribution, and submission does not create any employment or contractual relationship beyond this CLA.

8. This CLA shall be governed by the same jurisdiction as the License.
